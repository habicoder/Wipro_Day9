# Class Inheritance
# Given:

# Create a Bus class that inherits from the Vehicle class. Give the capacity argument of Bus.seating_capacity() a default value of 50.

# Use the following code for your parent Vehicle class.

class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, name, max_speed, mileage):
        self.name = name
        self.max_speed = max_speed
        self.mileage = mileage

    def seating_capacity(self, capacity):
        return f"The seating capacity of a {self.name} is {capacity} passengers"

class Bus(Vehicle):
    def seating_capacity(self, capacity=50):
        return super().seating_capacity(capacity)

# Example usage
bus = Bus("Bus", 100, 10)
print(bus.seating_capacity())
